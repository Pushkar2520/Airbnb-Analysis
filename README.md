# Process
- Collected and imported Airbnb listing dataset into the analysis tool
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data by handling missing values and filtering outliers
- Standardized formats for dates, prices, and text fields (e.g., neighborhoods, room types)
- Performed exploratory analysis on price, availability, reviews, and minimum nights
- Created visualizations to show distribution, trends, and relationships
- Analyzed KPIs like average price, review scores, and top-performing locations
- Derived insights to understand the impact of pricing, availability, and reviews on performance
  # Project Insights
- Listings with higher review scores tend to have moderate prices and fewer minimum nights.
- Top-performing neighborhoods have both high listing counts and strong occupancy rates.
- There is a wide price range, but extreme outliers often have lower booking activity.
- Properties with more availability days generally drive higher total revenue.
- Optimizing minimum stay requirements can improve booking frequency.
